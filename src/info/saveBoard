Usage: saveBoard (sb) [arg name]
Arguments: arg name - A file name to write to.
Description:
This command will by default write a Go Board file to /src/saveData/boards/board (Linux) or \src\saveData\boards\board (Windows). If provided with a name argument it will write to that name instead. Notably, if the file already exists the file name will be changed to "Filename" => "FilenameX", where X is some number.
