Contained within this directory is a .jar of our final project and all source files required to compile it.

The jar file has been tested and is able to be ran on the linux lab machines and Windows 7.

FOr linux, open a terminal in this directory and run the command "java -jar GoProblemSolver.jar".
FOr Windows, simply double click to run the jar.

Inside this directory is also another directory containing solved and unsolvable problems that can be loaded and played through using this program.  This directory is located at "src/saveData/boards/".  When loading a board, the program should open at this directory by default.
